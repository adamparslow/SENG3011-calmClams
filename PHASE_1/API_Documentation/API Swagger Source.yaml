    This is the documentation for the SENG3011 API for the CalmClams group. This API allows users to search for and access reports for disease outbreaks by time, location or key terms. Results are returned to the user as a JSON string in a consistent form for ease of use, described in the API-Response schema. This university project is intended to be able to contribute to the automated EpiWATCH epidemics detection system, which uses openly available data sources to produce outbreak alerts, analyses on serious or unusual outbreaks, and regular digests.
